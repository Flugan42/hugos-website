This is a sample post showing how math and footnotes render.

## Inline Math

The quadratic formula is $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$, which gives us the roots of any quadratic equation.

## Display Math

Euler's identity is often called the most beautiful equation in mathematics:

$$e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$$

Here's a more complex example with an integral:

$$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \sqrt{\pi}$$

## Footnotes

This is a sentence with a footnote[^1]. You can have multiple footnotes[^2] in a single post.

## Code

Here's some inline `code` and a code block:

```python
def hello():
    return "Hello, world!"
```

## Links

[^1]: This is the first footnote. It appears at the bottom of the post.

[^2]: This is the second footnote. Kramdown handles the numbering automatically.
